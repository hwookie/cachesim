This program implements a two-level cache simulator for our
project in ecen 4593.  I hope it can be of some help to 
future students who take the class in the future.

You will need to install libconfig to compile this program.
A copy of libconfig is located in the dependencies folder,
but you may wish to obtain it through other means, such as
package managment.
