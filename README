This program implements a two-level cache simulator for our final
project in ecen 4593.  We hope it can be of some help to students 
who take the class in the future.

You will need to install libconfig to compile this program.  A copy 
of libconfig is located in the dependencies folder, but you may 
wish to obtain it using a package manager.
