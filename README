This program implements a two-level write-back cache simulator for our final
project in ecen 4593.

You will need to install libconfig to compile this program.  A copy of libconfig 
is located in the dependencies folder, but you may wish to obtain it using a 
package manager.

Run the program as follows:

cat <trace> | ./cachesim <settings>

You can debug the program by compiling with debug flags and running the program
as follows:

cat <trace> | ./cachesim <settings> | grep -A 10 -B 5 "cache miss on C"

or something.

Settings can be passed as arguments in any order.  All settings are demonstrated
in .cacherc.
